Brief:

- easy to add new song titles and artists
- easy to rank the songs (drag and drop?)
- simple login (password in config file)


Technical:

As there will not be so many songs, we can just use an order number for each song. If we move song to a new place,
then every song below it will have its order number increased by one. Dee to the limited amount of songs, even in
worst case scenario, the update won't take too long to process (1000 - 3000 songs).

In order to not have to manually add all songs, import the playlist from iTunes. Some of those songs have a rating
(1-5 stars), we can convert those ratings to use the range 1-100 for a bigger range. We need to figure out what range
each star consist of.

Example:

0 stars: 0
1 star: 20
2 stars: 40
3 stars: 60
4 stars: 80
5 stars: 100




Database schema:

song:

    - id (uuid)
    - itunes_id (int) // if we someday want to import additional song metadata
    - name (varchar)
    - artist (varchar)
    - album (nullable, varchar)
    - rating
    - play_count
    - created_at
    - updated_at



Features:

    Lists:
        - top-20 songs

    Search:
        - by song name
